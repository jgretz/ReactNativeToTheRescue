# React Native To The Rescue
## Abstract
Users want their apps to be intuitive, seamlessly designed for their device. Developers want powerful tools that enable and encourage them to craft their vision into reality. Businesses want to reduce time to market, cost, and risk. In the world of mobile development, these desires are locked in conflict, inevitably leading to someone (or often everyone) losing. Although many tools have tried to answer the call, none have solved the problem without compromise. Users give up their native experience, developers are hindered by unfamiliar or subpar tools, and businesses spend more money while also increasing their risk.

React Native promises to answer these needs without the compromise. In this talk, we will explore how React Native empowers developers to create truly native apps that are enjoyable to use, while answering the real needs of business. Using the canvas of a cross platform app, this talk will walkthrough how React Native's approach enables quick and enjoyable development, reduces cost and complexity, and produces with an experience the same finesse as native development.
